#PHP Basics
1. Syntax
2. Operators
3. Variables
4. Control Structures
5. Language Constructs and Functions
6. Namespaces 
7. Extensions
8. Config
9. Performance/bytecode caching


#Note
1. Php variable case sensetive. $xx and $Xx not same.
2. PHP method or function name case insensitive. xx() and Xx() same.

#Tags 
In PHP 5, there are up to five different pairs of opening and closing tags available in PHP, depending on how PHP is configured. Two of these, &lt;?php ?&gt; and &lt;script language=&quot;php&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;, are always available. There is also the short echo tag &lt;?= ?&gt;, which is always available in PHP 5.4.0 and later. The other two are short tags and ASP style tags. As such, while some people find short tags and ASP style tags convenient, they are less portable, and generally not recommended. PHP 7 removes support for ASP tags and &lt;script language=&quot;php&quot;&gt; tags. As such, we recommend only using &lt;?php ?&gt; and &lt;?= ?&gt; when writing PHP code to maximise compatibility.

#Scaller Data Type
###Boolean
When converting to boolean, the following values are considered FALSE:
* the boolean FALSE itself
* the integer 0 (zero)
* the float 0.0 (zero)
* the empty string, and the string "0"
* an array with zero elements
* an object with zero member variables (PHP 4 only)
* the special type NULL (including unset variables)
* SimpleXML objects created from empty tags

**Every other value is considered TRUE (including any resource). To cast into boolean use (bool)**

###Integer
* Binaray Integer Literalas Start With 0b or 0B .. Example 0b111110101 or 0B1010101010
* Octal Integer Literals start with 0; if 8,9 found the cut out form here left or right.
* Hexa decimal integer start with 0x or OX
* Php integer is platform dependend so its size dependen to platform 32 or 64 bit. if PHP encounters a number beyond the bounds of the integer type, it will be interpreted as a float instead
* PHP dose not support unsined integer.
* Use either the (int) or (integer) casts.  A value can also be converted to integer with the intval() function.
