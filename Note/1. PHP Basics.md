#PHP Basics
1. Syntax
2. Operators
3. Variables
4. Control Structures
5. Language Constructs and Functions
6. Namespaces 
7. Extensions
8. Config
9. Performance/bytecode caching


#Note
1. Php variable case sensetive. $xx and $Xx not same.
2. PHP method or function name case insensitive. xx() and Xx() same.

#Tags 
In PHP 5, there are up to five different pairs of opening and closing tags available in PHP, depending on how PHP is configured. Two of these, &lt;?php ?&gt; and &lt;script language=&quot;php&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;, are always available. There is also the short echo tag &lt;?= ?&gt;, which is always available in PHP 5.4.0 and later. The other two are short tags and ASP style tags. As such, while some people find short tags and ASP style tags convenient, they are less portable, and generally not recommended. PHP 7 removes support for ASP tags and &lt;script language=&quot;php&quot;&gt; tags. As such, we recommend only using &lt;?php ?&gt; and &lt;?= ?&gt; when writing PHP code to maximise compatibility.

##Scaller Data Type
#Boolean
When converting to boolean, the following values are considered FALSE:

the boolean FALSE itself
the integer 0 (zero)
the float 0.0 (zero)
the empty string, and the string "0"
an array with zero elements
an object with zero member variables (PHP 4 only)
the special type NULL (including unset variables)
SimpleXML objects created from empty tags
Every other value is considered TRUE (including any resource).
