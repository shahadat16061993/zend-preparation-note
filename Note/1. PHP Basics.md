#Tags 
In PHP 5, there are up to five different pairs of opening and closing tags available in PHP, depending on how PHP is configured. Two of these, &lt;?php ?&gt; and &lt;script language=&quot;php&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;, are always available. There is also the short echo tag &lt;?= ?&gt;, which is always available in PHP 5.4.0 and later. The other two are short tags and ASP style tags. As such, while some people find short tags and ASP style tags convenient, they are less portable, and generally not recommended. PHP 7 removes support for ASP tags and &lt;script language=&quot;php&quot;&gt; tags. As such, we recommend only using &lt;?php ?&gt; and &lt;?= ?&gt; when writing PHP code to maximise compatibility.
